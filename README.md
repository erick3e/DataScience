# DataScience, Data Careers, Big Data

So you think you would like to begin a career with data?

Altough this field is not for everyone, there are many tracks and it is very rewarding both financially and career wise.

## First things first 
Why switch? Data is everywhere and every day more is generated. Everything around you is generating data. From your search history to your taxes. There's valuable data everywhere and that means someone needs to parse it, understand it, make it useful and companies profit from it.

** Where do I start? **
A good starting point is with a topic or field that interests you. I will use myself as an example, and my thought process that lead me here.
I was interested in healthcare, and how data (or systems or computers) could help make it better. I have a background in science so thought of it this way:
    1. What is a problem I would like to fix in healthcare? Long ER wait times
    2. What information is available for Emergency Rooms? (Business Knowledge, Procedures, MDs, RNs, etc)
    3. What happens from when a patient walks into the ER until he leaves? (Process Mapping)
    4. Is there data being captured there? (There is ALWAYS data, you just have to find it)

> The only requirement I would say you need to be sucessful in a data-related field, is **curiosity.** 

The next step essentially breaks down the different paths/careers in data.

    1. Data Collection/Gathering: This depends on the busines but there are essentially two scenarios.
        a. There is data available and being collected and is stored somewhere. This is the role of data architects/database administrators, system engineers, etc. People that design and monitor a system that collect and store data.

        b. There is no data: This is the role of a business analyst or process analyst, or middle management. Essentially someone goes and maps a business process and develops/hires a system to store that information (someone in a. above)
      Keywords: Data pipelines, ETL, ML Engineering, Data Engineering, DBA, Process Engineering

    2. Data Analysis: Once there is data somewhere being collected, someone needs to analyze it to help make decissions. This is the role of data analysts, business analysts, system analysts, etc. Essentially someone that makes sense of the data collected.
    Keywords: Python, R, SQL, Analytics

    3. Data Monitoring: This role is usally within IT. These are the people that are notified when something goes wrong, theres data missing, or there are errors.
    Keywords: DBA, IT support, PagerDuty, Splunk, Monitoring

    4. Data Visualization: This role can be the same person as the past 3 or its on unique role depending on the size of the organization. Titles here are data modeler, (BI) Business Intelligence Analyst, Business Analysts, etc. Their job is to present the analyzed data to management/leadership in a way they can understand it, and it can help them make decisions about the business. 
    Keywords: Tableau, PowerBI, ClickSense, QlickView

    5. Data Optimization/Automation: Roles here are all about designing a computer program (or algorithm) that does all the work for you, faster, better, stronger. Here is where the core of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) lives. Titles here are data scientist, AI developer, ML Engineer, AI programmer.
    Keywords: AI, ML, Data Science, models, deep learning, neural networks.

## Breaking In

Getting started in any of these fields can vary in difficulty, and you should look at the resources included here to help you find a track that interests you.

I think the easiest to break into is (2) Data Analysis and (3) Data Vizualisations. These two roles can be assigned to the same person, and I think if you have previous business knowledge you just gotta pick up the technical skills. Sucess in these roles is more of the how you present and analyze the data, than your tech skills. So lets talk about tech skills.

### Technical skills that anyone in data should have.

    1. **Excel**. Its the tried and true, you can perform almost any kind of analysis at a small scale in Excel. Its widely availble, you can get it for free, its been around forever, and there are plenty of tutorials and classes to get better at it. You can use it to store data, analyze it, vizualize it, and present it. Its limitations are that it cannot handle large datasets (1 million rows or more)

    2. **SQL**: SQL is the basis for all databases, its an easy programming language to learn, its widely used and even if you only learn the basics it can help you understand and how to think about data storage and databases.

    3. **Data Storage**: Have a high level concept of a Relational Database System (RDBS), NoSQL, Object Storage

    4. BI Tools: Tableau. Although there are others, tableau is quickly becoming the standard. There is a free version, a huge community, conventions and its very easy to learn and get started on it.

    5. Any programming language. Not a requirement but understanding how software is developed goes a long way. Current popular languages: Python- the default for data science. Go - quickly becoming the default for data architecture and infrastructure. C++ old but still releveant and still useful.

    6. Statistics: Don't need to be a statistician but at least freshen up on introductory statistics.

### Softskills

    1. Be eager to learn
    2. Communication skills
    3. Presentation SKills
